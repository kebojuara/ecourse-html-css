## Background Story
Actually, my task was only to create a single-page website containing information about a web programming course using HTML and CSS. But, during my spare time, I made the website better by adding some features and a bit of JavaScript. The result makes me quite proud and it can be developed further in the future to become a website that also has a backend.
